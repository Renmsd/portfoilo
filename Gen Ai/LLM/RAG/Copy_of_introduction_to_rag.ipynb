Then --\\\\n\\\\nSMASH!\\\\n\\\\nThe door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and\\\\nwith a deafening crash landed flat on the floor.\\\\n\\\\nA giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost\\\\ncompletely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled\\\\nbeard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles\\\\nunder all the hair.\\\\n\\\\nThe giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just\\\\nbrushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it\\\\neasily back into its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a\\\\nlittle. He turned to look at them all.\\\\n\\\\n\"Couldn\\\\\\'t make us a cup o\\\\\\' tea, could yeh? It\\\\\\'s not been an easy\\\\njourney...\"\\\\n\\\\nHe strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear.\\\\n\\\\n\"Budge up, yeh great lump,\" said the stranger.\\\\n\\\\nDudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching,\\\\nterrified, behind Uncle Vernon.\\\\n\\\\n\"An\\\\\\' here\\\\\\'s Harry!\" said the giant.\\', \\'\"Good luck, Harry,\" he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish\\\\nof his cloak, he was gone.\\\\n\\\\nA breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and\\\\ntidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect\\\\nastonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his\\\\nblankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside\\\\nhim and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was\\\\nfamous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours\\\\\\' time by Mrs.\\\\nDursley\\\\\\'s scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk\\\\nbottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and\\\\npinched by his cousin Dudley... He couldn\\\\\\'t know that at this very\\\\nmoment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up\\\\ntheir glasses and saying in hushed voices: \"To Harry Potter -- the boy\\\\nwho lived!\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCHAPTER TWO\\\\n\\\\nTHE VANISHING GLASS\\']'"
